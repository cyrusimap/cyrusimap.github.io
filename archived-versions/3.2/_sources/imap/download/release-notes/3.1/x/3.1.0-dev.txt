Major changes since the 3.0.x series
====================================

*

Updates to default configuration
================================

* The `specialusealways` option is now enabled by default. It must
  explicitly be disabled for interoperability with legacy clients that
  can't handle RFC 6154 attributes in extended LIST commands.

* The per-user calendar and addressbook administrative web user
  interfaces (e.g. /dav/calendars/user/<userid>) are now disabled by
  default.  They can be enabled with the `caldav_allowcalendaradmin`
  and `carddav_allowaddressbookadmin` options respectively.

Significant bugfixes
====================

*

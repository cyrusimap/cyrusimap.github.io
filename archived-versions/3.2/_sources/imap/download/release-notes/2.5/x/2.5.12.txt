Changes Since 2.5.11
====================

Release changes
---------------

Weâ€™re trialing using the Github Releases feature. If you have trouble
downloading this release, please report this to the mailing lists. Thanks!

Dependency changes
------------------

ClamAV now configures and builds correctly, using pkg-config for detection.
You can use the ``--without-clamav`` option to configure if you have ClamAV
installed but do *not* want to build Cyrus with support for it.  The old
``--with-clamav=DIR`` variant no longer works (but it also didn't work before!)

Cyrus should now build cleanly with LibreSSL 2.7 (thanks Bernard Spil).

Other changes
-------------

* Cyrus release version is now preserved across autoreconf runs.  This means
  it is now safe to run autoreconf on a release tarball source tree.

Changes Since 3.0.8
===================

Release changes
---------------

We're trialing using the Github Releases feature.  If you have trouble downloading
this release, please report this to the mailing lists.  Thanks!

Dependency changes
------------------

* ClamAV 0.101 is now supported (thanks Adam Gołębiowski)

New configuration options
-------------------------

* The new ``cyrus_group`` option in :cyrusman:`imapd.conf(5)` can be used to
  set the UNIX group that Cyrus processes run as (thanks Jakob Gahde).  The
  default is to use the primary group of the configured ``cyrus_user``.  The
  old ``--with-cyrus-group`` configure option has been non-functional for many
  years, and has been removed.
